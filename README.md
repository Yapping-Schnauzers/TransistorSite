# Yapping Schnauzers - Transistor Site

This repository contains the **raw HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript (jQuery)** files used to customize our public website: [yappings.com](https://yappings.com).

- Custom HTML structure
- Custom CSS styling
- jQuery enhancements
- Minor UX/UI improvements beyond the base Transistor.fm functionality
